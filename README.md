# US States Game

The US States Game is an interactive geography quiz built with Python's Turtle graphics library. The game challenges players to name all 50 states, displaying their guesses on a blank map of the United States. If a player decides to quit before naming all states, the game generates a CSV file listing the states they didn't guess, providing a fun and educational way to learn U.S. geography.
